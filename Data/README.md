I downloaded the data files from NOAA's Local Climatological Data (LCD) [site](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datatools/lcd) specifically focused on [West Lafayette](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets/LCD/stations/WBAN:14835/detail), Indiana. I downloaded the climate change indicator data from [Copernicus](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/search?type=dataset) [(CO2 Levels)](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/satellite-carbon-dioxide?tab=overview) [(Climate Indices)](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/sis-extreme-indices-cmip6?tab=overview) (GFDL-ESM4 (USA) Model and SSP3-7.0 for aerosol emissions) [(global temperature anomalies)](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/seasonal-postprocessed-single-levels?tab=overview). Need data on (NOx levels, other important aerosols, heat wave data, etc)

Naturally, it's important to read the [Dataset Documentation](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/cdo/documentation/LCD_documentation.pdf) before working with the data to understand how to deal with different values. For further understanding, please read NOAA's [GSOM Summary](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/cdo/documentation/GSOM_documentation.pdf).
