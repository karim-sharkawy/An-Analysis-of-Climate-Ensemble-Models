I downloaded the data files from NOAA's Local Climatological Data (LCD) [site](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datatools/lcd), focusing on West Lafayette, Indiana. Only the raw data is provided, please run the data through data_cleaning.py to get the initial preprocessed data. Naturally, it's important to read the [Dataset Documentation](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/cdo/documentation/LCD_documentation.pdf) before working with the data to understand how to deal with different values. For further understanding, please read NOAA's [GSOM Summary](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/cdo/documentation/GSOM_documentation.pdf).

Climate change indicator data is available on [Copernicus](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/search?type=dataset) [(CO2 Levels)](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/satellite-carbon-dioxide?tab=overview) [(Climate Indices)](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/sis-extreme-indices-cmip6?tab=overview) (GFDL-ESM4 (USA) Model and SSP3-7.0 for aerosol emissions) [(global temperature anomalies)](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/seasonal-postprocessed-single-levels?tab=overview). Need data on (NOx levels, heat wave data, etc.).
